📊 Just finished a fascinating lecture on probability distributions with Python! 🐍 We covered binomial, Poisson, uniform, normal, exponential, and hypergeometric distributions. Here's a quick summary:

1. **Binomial Distribution**: Used for two possible outcomes, like success or failure.
2. **Poisson Distribution**: Describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
3. **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes are equally likely within a given range.
4. **Normal Distribution**: Describes continuous data which have a symmetric distribution around a mean.
5. **Exponential Distribution**: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
6. **Hypergeometric Distribution**: Models the probability of drawing a specific number of successes in a fixed number of draws, without replacement.

I can't wait to apply these concepts to real-world problems! 💡 #DataAnalytics #Python #ProbabilityDistributions 📈🔍
